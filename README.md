# ASTERIX HACKATHON README

Welcome to the ASTERIX Hackathon! We're thrilled to show you our PGTA project, a coding challenge focused on developing an ASTERIX decoder for category 048. The primary objective is to create a robust decoder capable of exporting results to a CSV file from a binary file, which, besides visualization, will serve as valuable input data for future analysis, including Project 3.

## Decoder functionalities

1. **ASTERIX Decoder:**
   - Read a binary file in an understandable table format.
   - Save the decoded information as a CSV.

2. **ASTERIX simulation:**
   - View the binary CAT048 information of the flight paths on the map.
   - Restart, pause and end the time-based simulation.
   - Change velocities.
   - Change map features.

3. **ASTERIX KML extraction:**
   - Functionality to export flight trajectories to a KML file.
   - The KML file includes fight level or corrected height.
   - Foreach path in the KML the viewer can see the A/C ID, address, Mode 3A and TYP020.
