# ASTERIX HACKATHON README

Welcome to the ASTERIX Hackathon! We're thrilled to show you our PGTA project, a coding challenge focused on developing an ASTERIX decoder for category 048. The primary objective is to create a robust decoder capable of exporting results to a CSV file from a binary file, which, besides visualization, will serve as valuable input data for future analysis, including Project 3.

_Authors: Júlia Capella Campdepadrós, Paula Chalé Castell, Laia Costa Cid, Biel Gómez Crespo, David Movilla Cobo, Maria Ubiergo Gómez_

## Decoder functionalities

1. **ASTERIX Decoder:**
   - Read a binary file in an understandable table format.
   - Save the decoded information as a CSV.

2. **ASTERIX simulation:**
   - View the binary CAT048 information of the flight paths on the map.
   - Restart, pause and end the time-based simulation.
   - Change velocities.
   - Change map features.

3. **ASTERIX KML extraction:**
   - Functionality to export flight trajectories to a KML file.
   - The KML file includes fight level or corrected height.
   - Foreach path in the KML the viewer can see the A/C ID, address, Mode 3A and TYP020.

## User guide

1. **Import the binary file:**

Any .AST, .BIN or file can be uploaded. The result is shown in the same screen.

2. **Save in a CSV:**
It can be saved in any folder as a .csv file.

3. **Simulate the current binary file:**

# ASTERIX Executable Instructions

_This is a message for the teachers, who have the Drive access._


Due to severals technical issues, we can not provide you with a stable version of the setup. However, in the "Ejecutable - AsterixDecoderApp" folder you will find the "AsterixDecoder" application file, which has a different icon:

Run this version by just clicking on it, to test the decoder's capabilities.


## ENJOY!
